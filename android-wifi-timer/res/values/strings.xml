    <string name="info">Using <font fgcolor="#ffffffff"><b>Wifi timer</b></font> is easy! 
    Just turn-off the wifi using the power control widget or the settings menu.
    
    \n\nWhenever you set your wifi to <font fgcolor="#ffffffff"><b>off</b></font> 
    you will be prompted to enter
    the time at which you would like your wifi to be turned back on.
    
    \n\nThe timer will always be initialized to the current time, so if you want to set
    the timer for two hours, just tap the hour <font fgcolor="#ffffffff"><b>+</b></font>
    button twice.
      
    \n\nOnce the timer has been set, a notification will appear
    in the notification bar 
    indicating the time remaining.  
    You can select the notification to <font fgcolor="#ffffffff"><b>adjust</b></font> 
    or <font fgcolor="#ffffffff"><b>cancel</b></font> the timer.  
    You can also cancel the timer at any time by simply turning the wifi back on 
    using the power control widget or the menu settings.
    
    \n\nIf you decide you don\'t want to be prompted anymore, 
    just <font fgcolor="#ffffffff"><b>uninstall</b></font> the application.

    <string name="description">"Since 2.3.3 on my Nexus One, I started to have less
    battery time. I did this little app to save my battery while I'm at work and don't have 
    a wifi access point. I hope this application can be useful for you too!
    When this application is installed,
    each time you turn your wifi off you will be asked how long you
    would like before restoring it. After that period of time has
    passed, your wifi will be automatically turned back on."</string>
